# AbterCMS

AbterPHP is the first, and currently only, implementation of [AbterCMS](https://abtercms.com/): an open source, language agnostic, API-first, security-aware and scalable CMS. It aims to both provide a ready to use, easy to setup solution for simple landing pages that require an admin area for non-technical maintainers, and also to provide a good starting point for projects that want to start-off small but be prepared for rapid growth.
