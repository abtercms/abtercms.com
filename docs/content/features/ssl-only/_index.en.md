In 2019 it is still common practice to use `http` instead of `https` because it is somewhat easier to set up. While this is certainly true, it is already fairly easy to setup `SSL` certificates for your website.

For development and testing purposes we recommend [mkcert](https://mkcert.dev) and for staging and live environments we promote the use of [Letsencrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). Both are excellent tools that we're happy to recommend. Eventually we'll also have video tutorials for these tools demonstrating how to set them up on each of the major operating systems.
