Security can mean a lot of things, but in this day and age everyone needs to do their best to keep their own data, their customers' data and their partners' data safe from anyone who's not explicitly authorized access to that data. Building a secure system is not obvious, nor is it an absolute state of any existing system. We aim to be biased for security, even if it means we have to compromise usability or performance.

This document lists a couple of ways we find generally important, but keep in mind that implementations may provide even more security features in some cases.
