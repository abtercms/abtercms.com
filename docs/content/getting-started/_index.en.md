If you're looking for the fastest way to get started with AbterCMS, you'd have to look into the documentation of [the getting started guide for AbterPHP](https://abterphp.abtercms.com/en/getting-started), it's first implementation.

The rest of this documentation assumes that you want to understand the [design principles]({{% relref "design-principles/_index.en.md" %}}), [common features]({{% relref "features/_index.en.md" %}}) and [basic components]({{% relref "components/_index.en.md" %}}) of AbterCMS.
